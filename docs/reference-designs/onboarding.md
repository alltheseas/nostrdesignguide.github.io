Onboarding components will vary depending on the type of client. For example, if your client's sole purpose is to set up a user profile, then you may want to include additional steps such as relay selection. Here are some examples of onboarding flows:

## Social media client onboarding

The following mockups come from the Luna (nonexistant) client [design file.](https://www.figma.com/file/ThUW7QxTYT0BUxcH48uelG/Luna?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=ygHFbUBPAVUi4JzM-1) You have full permission to use it as you please.

<figcaption>We could make the notice much smaller or reduce it to an "urgent" icon to save on space. The ideas is to defer the keys step for a time convenient to the user.</figcaption>

## Mute Keywords and Lists
Clients have the option of including mute lists in onboarding. Mute lists are a great way to personalize a feed and avoid seeing topics that may not be of interest (like crypto). This should probably be done in combination with topic and or hashtag following.
