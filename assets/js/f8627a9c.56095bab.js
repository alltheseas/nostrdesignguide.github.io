This means that either the app or the user must assume the complexity without going so far as abstracting it away. For example, some of the core principles of Nostr are keys and relays. It would be tempting to simply hide relays and never expose users to them, but this would be a mistake. Users need to understand the concept of relays in order to understand how Nostr works. The same goes for keys, which are essential to how nostr operates. Simply renaming them to username and password would be abstracting away too far.
